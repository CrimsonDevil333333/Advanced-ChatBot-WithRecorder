He began his international cricket career at age 18, in a 1971 Test series against England.[12] Khan played until 1992, served as the team's captain intermittently between 1982 and 1992,[13] and won the 1992 Cricket World Cup, in what is Pakistan's first and only victory in the competition.[14] Considered one of cricket's greatest ever all-rounders,[15][16] Khan registered 3,807 runs and took 362 wickets in Test cricket[17] and was inducted into the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame.[13]

In 1991, he launched a fundraising campaign to set up a cancer hospital in memory of his mother.

PTI was also able to form a coalition government in the province of Punjab and act as a coalition partner to the Balochistan Awami Party in the province of Balochistan.
